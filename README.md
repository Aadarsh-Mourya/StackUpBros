<H1> Water Supply Management </H1>

Indore faces significant challenges in its water supply and sewerage systems and has declared a water emergency. 

The reliance on water from the distant Narmada River, transported via a costly pipeline, has revealed several critical issues. These include unmetered water connections, substantial leakage from old pipelines, and unauthorized connections, leading to inefficiencies and inequitable distribution. 

The Current Municipal Corporation of Indore (IMC) lacks the technology to monitor the distribution of this water at the household level.
It includes:
1. Inability to identify and address water wastage or leakages.
2. Difficulties in ensuring equitable distribution of water.
3. Lack of data to support decision-making for maintenance and upgrades of the water supply system.

Our objectives for these problems are:
1. To build a mechanism of water supply to measure and track the amount of water distributed to each household in Indore.
2. To develop a system for ongoing data collection on water usage at the household level to facilitate comprehensive analysis and reporting.
3. To track the substantial loss of water and leakages due to old and worn-out pipelines.


<h1>Detailed Steps Data Collection:</h1>

The water distribution system's data collection begins by identifying the wards and their respective overhead tanks, including each ward's unique LGD Code and total water requirements. 

Within each ward, houses are uniquely numbered, and detailed information is gathered, including house numbers, family details, addresses, total members, and individual water requirements. 

Meter readings are regularly recorded to monitor water consumption. Pipes connected to the overhead tanks are identified by their unique IDs and dimensions, while sensors are installed at critical points to measure water flow. 

Sensor data, including water flow readings and timestamps, is collected and integrated into a central database.
